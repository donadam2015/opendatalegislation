# Project Overview
Many open data implementations are the result of good management and their policies. But any good policy can be modified by a change in management. To make good policy permanent, the policy must be made into a law. The law must cover just enough detail to establish a framework that the open data implementation can be built upon. We highlight and review open data legislation.

# Publishing
* We started by creating the index directly in the ODI website
* Next if there are changes, once a week, the master branch opendatalegislation/index gets pushed into the master branch opendatainitiative.github.io/posts, master branch opendatalegislation/how-to and opendatalegislation/implementation get pushed  into master branch opendatainitiative.github.io/ root.
* Long term, we establish Continuous Delivery (CD) automation that deploys master on the established set schedule
