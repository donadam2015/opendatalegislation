  	department, or other agency in the executive, judicial, or

  	Education Code.
  	       (b)  Each state agency shall post on a generally accessible
  	Internet website maintained by or for the agency each high-value
  	data set created or maintained by the agency, if the agency:
  	             (1)  determines that, using existing resources, the

  	additional cost to the state;

  	information.
  	       (d)  The web page on which a state agency's high-value data
