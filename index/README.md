* Minor changes to existing files or new files that do not change the project significantly from the project editors, get merged
* Major changes to the project or proposed changes from users without project rights, use a pull request so the project editors can review your proposed changes. For help on pull requests, go here https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

# Publishing
* We started by creating the index directly in the ODI website
* Next the published master branch gets packaged and deployed into the ODI website once per week
* Long term, we establish Continuous Delivery (CD) automation that deploys master on the established set schedule
