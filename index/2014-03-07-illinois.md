10		        (2) Public data sets shall be updated as often as is
11		    necessary to preserve the integrity and usefulness of the

10		applications and shall, whenever practicable, use open
11		standards for web publishing and e-government.
12		    The manual shall identify the reasons why each technical
13		standard was selected and for which types of data it is
14		applicable, and may recommend or require that data be published
15		in more than one technical standard. The manual shall include a
16		plan to adopt or utilize a web application programming
17		interface that permits application programs to request and
18		receive public data sets directly from the web portal. The
19		manual and related policies may be updated as necessary.
20		    (d) The Office of the Governor shall consult with units of
21		local government, not-for-profit organizations with a
22		specialization in technology and innovation, agencies of other
23		states, academic institutions, and voluntary consensus

14		        (2) a summary explanation of how its plans, charters,
15		    budgets, capital expenditures, contracts, and other
16		    related documents and information for each information
17		    technology and telecommunications project it proposes to
18		    undertake can be utilized to support Illinois Open Data and
19		    related savings and efficiencies. The plan shall
20		    prioritize public data sets for inclusion on the single web
21		    portal on or before December 31, 2014, in accordance with

12		Security publication "Federal Cloud Computing Strategy" dated
13		February 8, 2011, all State agencies are required to evaluate
