# Overview
Open Data implementations require leadership. There must be an empowered, technically experienced individual or group to keep the open data law true to the policy ideals. Ohio has proposed a board, while California has proposed a data officer that reports to the governor.

Data Board or Data Officer leadership is accountable for
1. Categories of records are public records by default. Need to set a baseline that all departments can start from.
2. Recommend technology standards. These will be minimum requirements so extra work is not generated. Ability to export records in TXT format with recommended metadata headers. Open data system able to support exporting data through API using shared key. Commercial vendor product and open source project options with some high level recommendation of staffing requirements.
3. Recommend accounting standards. Utilizing the state accounting system is recommended. Otherwise there must be a minimum set of common terms and fields that the state and municipalities can agree on. These accounting standards set the baseline for reporting and publishing.
4. Recommend metadata standards. The metadata at a minimum define the field headers for the accounting standard fields.
Collaboration and participation with open government open data organizations such as data.gov (Federal GSA), Open Data Initiative, What Works Cities (Sunlight Foundation), and Data Coalition. Encourage representatives to hold board seats, participate in strategy discussions, and help to keep on top of evolving new options.
5. Make annual recommendations with updates
6. Meet at least 6 times per year with published agendas and meeting results. Follow Robert's rules?
7. Carrot or Stick: Either grant annual funds for annual participation with state open data system or create a certification system that allows publishing for annual compliance.

An archivist or librarian is accountable for the data publishing. The publishing process must be transparent and not require data modification.

Open Data Leadership sets the minimum quality, quantity, and frequency standards. The state departments and municipalities must at least mean the minimum to retain their certification and the ability to be published on the state open data portal.
